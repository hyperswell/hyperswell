# HyperSwell - an open source reverse ETL platform

We are excited to annonce HyperSwell - an open source reverse ETL platform. 
We are starting with a simple subset of features: moving data from your favorite DWH (Snowflake, BigQuery, RedShift) to your favorite business tools (Slack, Salesforce, Intercom, etc).

## Status
We are extremely early stage and will push code as it reaches very first usable version. Meanwhile feel free to open up an issue if you have any questions.

## Star to receive updates
